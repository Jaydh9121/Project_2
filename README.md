## Project 2 - howarth-ibrahim-hassanein-conley

# Project Proposal
- The goal of this project is to create an algorithm that analyzes credit scores and predicts consumer personal-loan eligibility. Weâ€™ll examine relationships between credit scores, monthly/annual incomes, outstanding debt, and other credit-influencing features.

# Data Collection
- We looked at various APIs and other data sources. As a starting point, we searched for a data set that had atleast 1,000 records and that had multiple features. We chose the follwoing data set: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/parisrohan/credit-score-classification. The data set is in csv format, and is easily read into a pandas datafame for cleaning, testing and analysis.   

# Project Roadmap: Predicting Consumer Personal-Loan Eligibilty
1. Data Acquisition and Exploration:

Obtain a dataset containing at least the following features: Occupation, annual income, monthly income, number of bank accounts, number of credit cards, number of loans, number of credit inquiries, outstanding debt, credit score. 
Explore the dataset to understand its structure, distributions, missing values, and potential relationships between features.

2. Data Preprocessing:

Handle missing values, if any, through imputation or removal.
Encode categorical variables using techniques such as one-hot encoding or label encoding.
Scale numerical features to ensure they have similar ranges.

3. Feature Engineering:

Create new features if necessary, such as debt-to-income ratio or credit utilization category.
Select relevant features based on domain knowledge and feature importance analysis.

4. Model Selection and Training:

Choose appropriate machine learning algorithms for the classification task, such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or Gradient Boosting.
Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Train the selected models on the training data.

5. Model Evaluation:

Evaluate the trained models using performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score on the testing data.
Compare the performance of different models and select the best-performing one.

6. Model Interpretation:

Interpret the trained model to understand which features are most influential in predicting loan approval.
Gain insights into the factors that affect loan approval decisions.

7. Model Deployment:

Deploy the final model as a predictive tool that can be used to assess loan eligibility automatically.
Integrate the model into the loan approval process of the organization, ensuring it meets regulatory and compliance requirements.

8. Next Steps:

Monitor the performance of the deployed model and update it periodically with new data.
Consider incorporating additional data sources or refining features to improve model accuracy and robustness.
Explore the possibility of implementing explainable AI techniques to provide transparent explanations for model predictions.

9. Documentation and Presentation:

Document the entire project process, including data preprocessing, model development, and evaluation.
Prepare a presentation summarizing the project goals, methodology, findings, and next steps.
Communicate the results effectively to stakeholders, including management, data scientists, and business users.
